A very simple clickslave and AI bot for Cookie Clicker.

Included:

- Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey-compatible user script
- PhantomJS bootstrap script for console-based testing
- launch.bat for quickly launching the script via PhantomJS,
  optionally with a clicks-per-second parameter.

Prerequisites:

- PhantomJS must be in your PATH.

Written on Windows, but should be compatible with any
PhantomJS-compatible platform (with the exception of launch.bat which
is trivial).
